# June 18th: Getting Started - Picking a design, and parts for the controller!

I want to make a Hitbox controller. Right now, I would like to make sure that my design is/has:
- A White colored base
- Black/Red (color choice is tentative) buttons that light up beneath the buttons when they are pressed/
- Potential to remove the case and put art underneath for extra design options.
- USB-C Port
- Around 4 Smaller buttons at top of controller
Style:
- White Case with black or red buttons (will decide later :D)


Dimensions of A retail hitbox
- Case: 40.6cm x 17.9cm x 4.9cm)
- Buttons: 24mm, 30mm 

Tentative (Parts):
- Xiao-rp2040-dip 
- Frosted acrylic sheet
- SK6812 MINI LED xhowever many u want (if more than 10 ull need a seperate battary for them)
- 11 24 mm button caps
- 1 30 mm button cap
- 12x Kailh low profile 
- 4x 6x6x7mm tact switches
- Screws
- Rubber Feet
- Soldering iron

In my work time today, I had to think about how I wanted the controller to end up looking and feeling. A major point of focus was on the size of the controller. I listed the dimensions of the hitbox above as an example that is much bigger than what I want in my controller. I will need to make a model of the controller to figure out exact dimensions of the case. Additionally, I created a draft of a list of parts and tools I will need for my project. 

Today was my first day off from school, and I got to spend my evening planning for my project. I know that I am a late start, but I hope that I can make up the time at some point. Additionally, my progress will be further delayed by an exchange trip I am leaving for on the 26th. I hope that I will have enough time to finish my project during the time after I get back, as I will be gone for a while. I will definitely talk more about that as the date approaches though :). Overall, I think I had a productive first day working on my project, and I am looking forward to working more on it! 

**Total Time Spent: 1h**
